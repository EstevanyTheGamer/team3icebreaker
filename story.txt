One fall day, I found myself eating the most delicious Apfelkuchen.
One day I want to visit a Biergarten during Oktoberfest so I can try some new beers. 
While there, I would also like to try a Bratwurst!
Hopefully there will be a Rammstein playing while we are all eating and drinking.
I'll be sure to wear my best dirndel!
I have always wanted to try some authentic gebaeck from Germany, so this would be the best time.
I found a gorgeous nerby schloss to travel to and enjoy the day.
I saw a hund that was bigger than me enter the castle!
